### Fedora COPR repo for Fira Code Fonts

This repo contains the spec files used in generating an SRPM which are in-turn used to create a .rpm package for Fedora.

This is a fork of https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/evana/fira-code-fonts/, made so that newer versions of Fira Code Fonts can be delivered faster via auomated webhooks and integration with the main Fira Code Fonts [repo](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

Note: Builds are only done for x86_64, other chroot environments (i368, aarch64, ppc64) are intentionally not built for. If you'd like for them to be included, please raise an issue.
