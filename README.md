### Fedora COPR repo for Fira Code Fonts

This repo is a fork of [evana's fira-code-fonts repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/evana/fira-code-fonts). It contains the spec files used in generating an SRPM which are in-turn used to create a .rpm package for Fedora.

COPR builds are done [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/cyfrost/packages/builds/), and the upstream code lies [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

~~Note: Builds are only done for x86_64, other chroot environments (i368, aarch64, ppc64) are intentionally not built for. If you'd like for them to be included, please raise an issue.~~
